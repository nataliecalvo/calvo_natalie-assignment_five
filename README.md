My [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nataliecalvo/calvo_natalie-assignment_five)

- I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp) to help me create my custom listening events.
- I used [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) to figure out what was going wrong with my code.

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.
